# Knowing Your TCO

- what is the problem I am trying / being asked to solve
- constraints are good, make sure we understand the cost and risks along the way
- going to be easier to go (upscale) from web standards -> lib / framwork, rather than downgrade or go lateral
- look for who really benefits in all this, man (sales, marketing) - I am the walrus

<!-- 
- what would make for the best user experience, then think, how can I make it easier on myself, _then_ find my way to the right developer experience
- ask yourself, don't let others tell / do it for you
-->
