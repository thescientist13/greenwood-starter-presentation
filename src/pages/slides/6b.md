# Knowing Your TCO

- What is the problem I am trying / being asked to solve
- Constraints are good
- Going to be easier to go (upscale) if more technology is needed later
- What will this be like in 5 years

<!-- 
- what would make for the best user experience, then think, how can I make it easier on myself, _then_ find my way to the right developer experience
- ask yourself, don't let others tell / do it for you
-->
