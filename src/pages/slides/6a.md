# Knowing Your TCO

- What is the problem I am trying to solve and why?
- Constraints are good!
- Going to be easier to upscale if more technology is needed later.

<!-- 
- what is the problem I am trying / being asked to solve
- constraints are good
- what would make for the best user experience, then think, how can I make it easier on myself, _then_ find my way to the right developer experience
- going to be easier to go (upscale) from web standards -> lib / framwork, rather than downgrade or go lateral
- look for who really benefits in all this, man
- ask yourself, don't let others tell / do it for you
- make sure we understand the cost and risks along the way
