# The Spectrum of Developer Experience

- should this come after technical accounting?
- meta frameworks
- this is not about how good they, they are all "good" and useful, but it's a matter and tradeoff of complexities, costs, risks
- it's like a glaciar where the top gets smaller but the bottom gets bigger as you go from left to right
- what can be taken for granted / have in common
  - live reload
  - optimization steps
- what is in the middle (JS in JS layer)
  - libs / frameworks
  - bundlers (but just for production?)
- what is at the end (on a line)
  - meta frameworks
  - HMR
  - XYZ-in-JS
  - TypeScript
